Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

# 풀이
```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        # 주어진 기호들을 dict 자료형에 매핑시켜 넣기
        romans = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}

        # 나머지 숫자 두개의 조합들은 순차적 파싱을 사용
        answer = 0
        prev_value = 0

        # 문자열을 역순 처리한 뒤, 현재 값이 이전 값보다 크거나 같으면 총합에 더해주고 그렇지 않은 경우는 빼기
        # 일련의 과정을 거친 후, 이전 값을 업데이트
        for char in reversed(s):
            value = romans[char]
            if value >= prev_value:
                answer += value
            else:
                answer -= value
            
            prev_value = value
        
        return answer
